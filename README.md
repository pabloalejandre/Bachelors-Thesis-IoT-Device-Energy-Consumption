- Description:

Energy efficiency is one of the key performance requirements in the 5G network to ensure user experience and to enable scenarios such as Factory 4.0 and smart city. A portion of devices, especially the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), run on limited energy, supported by the batteries not replaced over the lifetime.

Therefore, the evaluation of the power consumption and the battery life has received increased attention. Multiple analytical models are used to estimate the battery lifetime, however, a validation of the models is required using the latest 3GPP specification requirements for IoT devices.

In this thesis, the student shall focus on implementing a state of the art device energy consumption model and evaluate the model for different use cases of IoT devices.


- Requirements:
1. Good knowledge of Python or Matlab programming.
2. Good mathematical background.
3. Knowledge of Mobile Networks (RAN).

- Implementation tasks:
1. Implementation of the device energy consumption analytical model based on the Markov chain, defined in the reference paper. The model will be implemented in the 5G and Beyond simulator and will be used as a baseline for our energy consumption model for devices in 5G.
2. Evaluation of energy consumption and the battery lifetime for Reduced Capability devices.
